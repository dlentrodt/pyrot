# pyrot

*pyrot* is a python software package for the physics of one-dimensional (1D)
Fabry-Pérot cavities containing two-level atoms interacting with the light-field.
In particular, it implements linear dispersion theory and allows to calculate 
scattering observables.

Note that this software package is mainly designed with the goal of transparency
and to illustrate theoretical concepts. It is not designed for numerical
efficiency or realistic practical applications.

## Installation

It is recommended to first create a virtual environment.

*pyrot* can then be installed using

    pip install pyrot-0.0.0.tar.gz

where the tar-ball can be found in the distributions directory `dist/`.

## Documentation

A detailed documentation is currently not available and will be added at a
later time. Somewhat self-explanatory simple examples can be found in `demo/`.
