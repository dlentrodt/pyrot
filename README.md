QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python
================================

[D. Lentrodt](https://github.com/dlentrodt)

*pyrot* is an open-source python software package for the physics of one-dimensional (1D)
Fabry-PÃ©rot cavities containing two-level atoms interacting with the light-field.
In particular, it implements linear dispersion theory and allows to calculate 
scattering observables.

Note that this software and its algorithms are mainly designed with the goal
of transparent physics and to illustrate theoretical concepts. It is *not*
designed for realistic practical applications or numerical efficiency.

Installation
------------

It is recommended to first create a virtual environment.

*pyrot* can then be installed using

    pip install pyrot-0.0.0.tar.gz

where the tar-ball can be found in the distributions directory `dist/`.

Documentation
-------------

A detailed documentation is currently not available and will be added at a
later time. Explanatory simple examples can be found in `demo/`.
